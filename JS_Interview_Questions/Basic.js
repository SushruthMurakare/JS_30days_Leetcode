// 1. What is JavaScript ?
// Browsers can only understand html, css and js where js is for dynamic functionality. All the browsers have javascript engine in it.
// Chrome - v8
// firefox - spider monkey
// safari - javascript core
// edge - chakra

// JS in programming language that is used to converting static web pages to interactive and dynamic web pages

// 2. What are datatypes? What are primitive datatypes ?

// Datatype determines the type of value in the variables

// Primitive Datatypes - Numbers, Strings, Boolean, Null, undefined
// They are immutable and hold only single value , when modifies the reference of new location will be stored 
// They are simple data types

// Non Primitive - Object, Array, Function, Date, RegExp
// they can hold multiple values
// they are mutable
// They are complex data types

// Array - used to store a collection of value , 
// index can be accessed
// push , map, filter, find


// Function - it is a block of code that performs a specific task and may return a value
// Object - data type that stores the data as key value pair


// Scope - the limit of using a variable
// local scope and global scope

// var, let, const
// var - var creates a function scope
// let - block scoped
// const - block scoped and value cannot be changed


// Loops - Programming way to run a set of instructions repeadtedly until a certain condition
// Types of loops
// For , While, do-while, for...of, for..in

// for...of is similar to map
// for..of is for object keys

// forEach - can do both tasks done by for of and for in
// forEach can take a function and will be exceuted for all the elements/items

// ForEach is a modern way to iterate and has better performance

// == and === in JS
// == -> only checks for values not the data type
// ==== -> checks both value and datatype
